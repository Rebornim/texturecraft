//! The eyedropper: a pipette lying from its tip at the bottom left to its rubber bulb at the top right. A thin glass tube drawn
//! as an outline (hollow, so it reads as glass), a collar wider than everything else, then a round solid bulb: the collar and the
//! slim tube under a fatter bulb are what tell a pipette from a baster. The panels draw it as a glyph; the pointer an armed pick
//! shows fills the same outline white
