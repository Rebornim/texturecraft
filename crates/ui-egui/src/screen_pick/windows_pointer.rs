//! Windows: while an eyedropper pick waits for a click outside the app, the system's pointers are the eyedropper over every app
//! and monitor. A keeper process (this program started with `KEEPER_ARG`) swaps them and puts the user's own back when the pick
//! ends, and also when the app goes away for any reason: it watches the app's process, so the system pointer is never left
//! changed. The keeper is started with the system's start-up feedback off: Windows otherwise shows its "app starting" pointer
//! (an arrow with a busy circle) over every app for up to seven seconds after a program starts, until the program first calls
//! `GetMessage`, which a keeper never does, and that pointer showed instead of the eyedropper. Once the keeper has kept the
//! user's pointers and shown the eyedropper, the app swaps in the eyedropper with its live colour disc; the keeper still puts
//! the user's own back
